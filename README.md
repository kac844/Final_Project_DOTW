# Final_Project_DOTW
For my final project, I wanted to create a virtual art gallery where each 'exhibit' serves as a presentation of my interpretation of three different art styles: Dadaism, Cubism, and Expressionism. 

## Background Information:
"Dadaism was an art movement formed during the First World War in Zurich in negative reaction to the horrors and folly of the war. The art, poetry and performance produced by Dada artists is often satirical and nonsensical."(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/dada)

"Cubism was a revolutionary new approach to representing reality invented in around 1907–08 by artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. They brought different views of subjects (usually objects or figures) together in the same picture, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented and abstracted."(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/cubism)

"Expressionism refers to art in which the image of reality is distorted to make it expressive of the artist’s inner feelings or ideas."(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/expressionism)


## Outline
### General:
Each 'exhibit' will be a different art style that will take the form of 3 different web pages. Each web page will have a custom static background and a main object/subject that will serve to represent the art style from my perspective.
#### Prototype
For my prototype, I decided to use Dadaism as my basic outline for the project. The page currently is very basic as I wanted to show a general idea of what I plan my pages to look like. For example, the background is static as I plan to use a static background for the pages. The main object will be in the front as the flame animation and text represent. The web pages will be about different topics that will take form in a specific art style. For my Dadaism art style, I decided to go for a political route as shown in the prototype.
 
### Dadaism and Prototype Information
For Dadaism or Dada, which stemmed from the response to WW1, my web page will be in response to the current global issue, the COVID-19 Pandemic. For the background, I plan to create a sort of collage, which was a common medium for Dada artists to use, of news articles that relate to our current situation. In my prototype, the background is black as I plan to use the black background as part of my collage. 

I also plan to use sounds from various news outlets as background music. For the animation, I was inspired by a Dada Sculpture by Marcel Duchamp, 'Bicycle Wheel', which is a ready-made, a termed coined by Duchamp to "describe prefabricated, often mass-produced objects isolated from their intended use and elevated to the status of art by the artist choosing and designating them as such.", to use previous animations from my other projects and change what their original purpose was. I plan to use 1-2 more animations from my previous projects, to the already existing animation in the prototype, for the final project.

### Cubism
For Cubism, I plan to use geometric shapes in various forms and colors which will come together to create an image. For the background, I plan to use a neutral background that appears textured as I want for the image created to be the main focus of the work. For the animation, since I want the image to be the main focus of the page, I will focus on the colors used on the shapes. I plan to use color-changing animations which depending on the shape will change to certain colors or change at certain speeds or change when interacted with etc. 

### Expressionism
For Expressionism, since the artwork usually expresses emotional experiences, I want to focus on a certain mood and recreate an image that helps the viewer experience that said mood. For the background, I plan to keep it simple as the main focus is on the main object/objects on the page. For the animation, I plan to have some sort of distortion of images and videos, which will serve as the main objects of the page. I also plan on using sounds/music in the background.
