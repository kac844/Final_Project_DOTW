# Final_Project_DOTW
For my final project, I wanted to create a virtual art gallery where each 'exhibit' serves as a presentation of my interpretation of three different art styles: Dadaism, Cubism, and Expressionism. 

Background Information:
"Dadaism was an art movement formed during the First World War in Zurich in negative reaction to the horrors and folly of the war. The art, poetry and performance produced by Dada artists is often satirical and nonsensical in nature."(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/dada)

"Cubism was a revolutionary new approach to representing reality invented in around 1907–08 by artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. They brought different views of subjects (usually objects or figures) together in the same picture, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented and abstracted."(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/cubism)

"Expressionism refers to art in which the image of reality is distorted in order to make it expressive of the artist’s inner feelings or ideas."(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/expressionism)


Outline
Each 'exhibit' will be a different art style that will take the form of different web pages. Each web page will have a custom static background and a main object/subject that will serve to represent the art style from my perspective.

For Dadaism or Dada, which stemmed from the response to WW1, my web page will be in response to the current global issue, the COVID-19 Pandemic. For the background, I plan to create a sort of collage, which was a common medium for Dada artists to use, of news articles which relates to our current situation. In my prototype, the background is black as I plan to use the black background as part of my collage. I also plan to use sounds from various news outlets as a background music. For the animation, I was inspired by a Dada Sculpture by Marcel Duchamp, 'Bicycle Wheel', which is a ready-made, a termed coined by Duchamp  to "describe prefabricated, often mass-produced objects isolated from their intended use and elevated to the status of art by the artist choosing and designating them as such.", to use previous animations from my other projects and change what there original purpose was. You see this in my prototype with the flicker animation, which was originally used to show a moving flame, and is now used to show flickering/jumping  text on screen. I plan to use 1-2 more animations from previous projects for the final project.

For Cubism, I plan to use geometric shapes in various forms and colors which will come together to create a image. For the background, I plan to use a neutral background that appears textured as I want for the image created to be the main focus of the work. For the animation, since I want the image to be the main focus of the page, will focus on the colors used on the shapes. I plan to use a color changing animations which depending on the shape will change to certain colors or change at certain speeds or change when interacted with etc. 

For Expressionism, since the artwork usually express emotional experiences, I want to focus on a certain mood and recreate a image that helps the viewer experience that said mood. For the background, I plan to keep it simple as the main focus is on the main object/objects on the page. For the animation, I plan to have some sort of distortion of an images and videos , which will serve as the main objects of the page. I also plan on using sounds/music in the background.
